# The [CSU](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) Navigation

Because the stupid design of the school official site, I would like to create a navigation for school websites and other
common websites.

Inspired by [ZJUers轻首页](https://zjuers.com/).
Some ideas of functions are from [ BYR-Navi
](https://github.com/BYR-Navi/BYR-Navi).
All the code is written by myself.
